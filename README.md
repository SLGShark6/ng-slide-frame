# Coming Soon...
# ng-slide-frame
The Angular carousel library that tries to let you use it, exactly how you want to.

## Why?
I'm a bit tired of searching around for a reliable carousel library, that doesn't make assumptions about how it's supposed to look, or the structure of data. I aim to fix that with this library by providing a set of bare bones functionalities that allow me to decide layout and feel on a per implementation basis.

# N.B
This is work in progress and will be generally unstable until an actual release is tagged. But if you have any suggestions for the work so far, feel free to open an issue.
